### Code to Highlight
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { 
            finch.setWheelVelocities(200, 100, 1000); 
            finch.stop();
```

### Choose At Least Three of the Following to Include:
 ### What was your motivation?
 My motivation for this design was a long time fascination with movies that included like a gambling/casino scene. I vividly recall scenes featuring security making sure the game was usually fair and there were like robots to make sure if cheating was going on.This vision of precision and efficiency influenced how I designed this robot attachment.This robot also makes it like a seemless flowing game instead of someone having to shuffle and then deal the cards
 
### What problem does it solve?
The problem my robot attachment solves would be the issue of being able to deal player cards that would typically take the player a good bit to shuffle and deal the cards.

### What did you learn?
- I learn how to problem solve design that would fail
- I learn how to design a feature that could help others
- I learn how to code a finch robot
